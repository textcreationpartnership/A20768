1. THE YOVNGER BROTHERS APOLOGIE.

    _ CHAP. I. The Occaſion of writing this Apology, is to proue, that Fathers may in ſome caſes diſpoſe of their worldly Eſtates to which of their Sonnes shal reaſonably pleaſe &c. for ſo much therof as they will; and that to be Lawfull by the Law of God, of Nature, and of Nations.

    _ CHAP. II. That the grounds of all good Conſtitutions being in Nature; yet shee, neither before, nor after the law of Propriety eſtablished did cōmaund, that all should be left to any one, more then to another.

    _ CHAP. III. That the breach of ſome written lawes of God vpon warrant of the Primarie law of Nature, is without ſinne: and that therfore there can be no ſuch right in Primogeniture, which is not in the Fathers power to auoyd, though there were a precept to the contrarie, as there is not.

    _ CHAP. IIII. That nations begining to deniſe ſundry formes of ſetling Inherit•nces, the Romanes eſpecially therin reſpected the free power of Fathers; the right of Children to their Fathers eſtates begining only at their Fathers Death.

    _ CHAP. V. That the preſent cuſtome in our Cōntrey of giuing all, or almoſt all to the Eldeſt, was neuer ſo begun, that it meant to exclude iuſt remedies for ſuch euills, as should growe out of the abuſe of that cuſtome, when it may make Fathers guilty of their ſonnes faults, and of their families ruines.

    _ CHAP. VI. That it is no offence before God for a Father, being tenant in fee-ſimple, to diſinherit the eldeſt, or to parcell his eſtate vpon cauſe: & that extreme vices of Heyres apparent, togeather with the fewer meanes which younger Brothers haue now to liue on, then heeretoſore, cryeth out againſt the contrary opinion.

    _ CHAP. VII. That Fathers being tenants in Fee-tayle, may likewiſe without ſcruple of Conſcience, diſcontinue the state-taile vpon cauſe, and deuiſe the ſame at their reaſonable pleaſure.

    _ CHAP. VIII. That vnthriftines is one knowne name of many hidden ſinns, and is alone a ſufficient cauſe of diſinheriſon, proued by the Law of God and Man.

    _ CHAP. IX. The maine points of the Premiſſes exemplified in diuers particuler Facts, aſwell of Princes, as of priuate Men.

    _ CHAP. X. That the Law of Naturall Equity & Reaſon confirme iust Diſinheriſion. & that the riotous liues of Elder Brothers deſerue that vehement reproofe with which the Author cloſeth vp this Treatiſe.
